# Java-Data-Structures

The notes of the Udemy course - Java Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass ([Link to the Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-data-structures-and-algorithms-masterclass/)) . This course clearly explains all the Data Structures concepts with examples. This was really helpful in my placements.
